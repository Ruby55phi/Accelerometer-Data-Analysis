We predict animal behavior based on data obtained from a tri-axial accelerometer.
The training data consists of multiple days of acceleration recordings for each type of behavior.
The accelerometer records data at intervals no longer than 100 milliseconds.
These time-series signals are transformed into feature representations, which are then used to build a model.
Finally, a Random Forest classifier is trained, and performance is evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score.
